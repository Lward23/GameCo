# GameCo

Project Brief

GameCo wants to use data to inform the development of new games. 
As such, you’ve been asked to perform a descriptive analysis of a video 
game data set to foster a better understanding of how GameCo’s new games 
might fare in the market.

For this project, I did an analysis of the video game sales for GameCo in different geographic regions over a series of years. The idea was to make a strategy for 2017 sales.
